# Lab 1 Information and Materials

## Lab 1.1
Template SRS for creating a webmap which displays Brown Marmorated Stinkbug populations in various Minnesota cities.

## Lab 1.2
### Part 1
A .CSV file containing instructions for creating a polygon using different software and coding languages/modules, including arcpy, fiona, and SQL.

### Part 2
Python code which first creates a polygon with the arcpy module and saves it to a PostgreSQL geodatabase. Then, creates a Flask application which outputs the polygon in GeoJSON format into a public IP address. And finally, displays a polygon as an ArcGIS webmap which can change in real-time by the operator.

### Part 3
An instruction video which directs viewers through how the API was created, including the Python code, PostgreSQL instance, and final output.
