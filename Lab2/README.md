# GIS 5572 Lab 2

This folder contains the deliverables for lab 2 in GIS5572 at the University of Minnesota including a Jupyter Notebook for QA/QC of brown marmorated stinkbug data in Minnesota, the filled-out evaluation metrics table, the updated SRS, and an updated data flow diagram depicting the relationship between data and PostGIS.

## Note:
The evaluation metrics table contains summation symbols which cannot be recognized in .csv format in Github, so both the Excel document and .csv have been added.
